  Once upon a time there was a small city in which all the citizens were
   obsorbed in the local weather forcast.The plain looking weatherman was
   speaking into the camera with a concerned expression, announcing the
  approaching storm.Though the storm was only a category one hurricane,
  the entire town panicked! Every last small minded, easliy scared citizen
  lost their mind....literally! Enter Terry, Mind Wrangler Extraordinaire!
